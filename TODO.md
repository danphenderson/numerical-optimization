# Table 1
- random points, number of positive and negative eigenvalues and median.
  
# Table 2
- stuff from stalled minimizations, evals(+/-), gradient
- Quasi Newton scheme defaults in mathematica. 


DH:
Implement missing programs in UncNLPrograms.jl
Validated program accuracy against CUTE
    - Consider using `ADNLPModels.jl`
Vary dimensions
Randomly pick a few interesting problems to look into in depth
    - Build on `RosenProbe.nb`
