His attempt to overcome the block-box nature of CUTEst.jl is unfinished, and apart of the https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/OptimizationProblems.jl package. The majority of problems are small dimensional and constrained, however, there are some useful ones in there. However, there have been issues reported with errors in the translation. It appears a lot of students did this for an assignment. \n",
