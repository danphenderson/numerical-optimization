# numerical-optimization
This repository is all things pertaining to numerical optimization.

#### Developer Note (danphenderson)
The majority of my commits of _.ipynb_ files (Jupyter Notebooks) are notes from Nocedal and Wrights text on Numerical Optimization. I do not explicitly reference them as a source in each document, however, the bulk of the material contained in each notebook originate from the aforehand mentioned bibtex citation.
My neglect to be more thorough is because this repository is a working project.
When my notebooks do contain information from other sources, I do my best to cite such source in-place (generally in an informal url link to the medium).


_The aforehand mentioned citation:_
